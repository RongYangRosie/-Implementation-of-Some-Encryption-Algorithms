RSA is one of the first practicalpublic-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. In sdddd a skfhdidfb, the encryption key is public and differs from the decryption key which is kept secret. In RSA, this asymmetry is based on the psdfgtal difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, the factoring problem. RSA is made of the initial letters of the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, who first publicly described the algorithm in 1977. Clifford Cocks, an English mathematician working for the UK intelligence agency GCHQ, had developed an equivalent system in 1973, but it was not decsdfdgeed until 1997.
